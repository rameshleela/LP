## Rules

Key agent information when 2 or more of the fields are available.

Agent information can only be entered if we have the following Information available

**We need at least 2 fields to take agency details**
1. Agency name + Address + Zip code
2. Agency name + Phone number
3. Agency name + Fax number
4. Agency Address + Zip code + Phone or Fax number

When we have both agency name and agent name in the document we should capture the 'agent name' for agent comp name.

When document has Agency and broker information we should give the priority for whichever is having more information. If both have same information first priority will be agency.

**Agent Fax & Phone:** Capture the 10 digits number for both, if number is not available in the image, leave the field blank. If there are two numbers and they are not specified as Phone & Fax, consider the first number as Phone & the second one as Fax. 

**Agent Zip, City & State:** The zip code will be either 5 or 9 digits. If the zip code has less than 5 digits we leave the field blank. If the code has more than 5 or less than 9 digits, we capture the first 5 digits only.
Note: Application is automated with the feature of capturing City & State when we enter zip code.

**Agent Address:**
- Scenario 1: If you have a mailing address that includes both a street address and PO Box address – in that instance, ignore the PO BOX address portion and just enter Street address
- Scenario 2: If you have only PO BOX address for agent address.   In that case, we can enter the PO Box address in the Agent Address field.

Key the address as on the document as it appears without abbreviation. do not capture special characters (except for PO box address)

**Note:** Agent Name / Address / Phone & Fax Numbers can be captured from a **fax cover sheet** if it is not available in the home page.
